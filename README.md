# Pygame-Jam-Dimensions
source code for the game

requirements -> pygame, python 3.9

python 3.9 mainly because of typehinting
to make it python 3.7 compatitable, just replace all `list` and `tuple` usages with `List` and `Tuple` respectively
you can import them from the typing module
[ `from typing import List, Tuple` ]
